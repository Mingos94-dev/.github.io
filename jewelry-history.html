    <p>
      The history of jewelry in Europe stretches back thousands of years, from ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Romans, through the Middle Ages, Renaissance, Baroque, and up to the modern era. Jewelry has served as a symbol of status, wealth, and artistic expression, evolving in style and technique across centuries.

      During the Middle Ages, jewelry often indicated social rank, with religious motifs and gemstones popular among royalty and nobility. The Renaissance brought a revival of classical arts, and jewelry became more elaborate and decorative.
